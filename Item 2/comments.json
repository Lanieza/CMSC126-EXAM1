With wide screen monitors, this could be very cool.<br>Only suggestion is to have lover the width of the scores column for each post and the subreddit side bar so there is more room for the content.",

A sweet spot with columns needs to be found where there is enough space to view everything perfectly. Since I just quickly put this one together, I didn't really spend much time finding that right balance.",

I guess we could view things in brackets much like forwards from the uncle you otherwise don't communicate with. DAE blah blah = FWD: FIND: Fwd: You gotta read this!",
